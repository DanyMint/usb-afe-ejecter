It's small program eject USB by hotkey on python

One day my Flash card broke. I hadn't understand reason of usbs broke but I decided create program wich wil safe eject usb card by hotkey. `Alt+f1`.

⌨️ Hotkeys:
- `Alt+f1` open window with all card which connect to PC.
- `double tap space` select usb card for eject. 

⚠️ Problems
- Today program work only on Windows.
- for select usb need tap to key twice
